# nba-scoreboard
This Google Chrome extension launches a small NBA scoreboard popout overlay (similar to most Chrome extension pop-outs). This repository is for the front-end extension only (built in ReactJS) - the backend for this application can be found at https://github.com/krumbot/nba-stats-backend .

#### Features:
- Get scores by date
- Refresh scoreboard
- Click on a game to be linked to the NBA.com box score
